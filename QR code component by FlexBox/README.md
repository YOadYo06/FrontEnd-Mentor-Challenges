# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

The only thing that I would say is that I didn't read the style-guide.md file and I am sorry for that .
I want to say also that in every type of the Media Queries (Small, Medium, and Large) you only look the first media query of each one because in the other ones I only change some properties values.
